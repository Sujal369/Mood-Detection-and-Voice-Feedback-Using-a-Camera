# Mood-Detection-and-Voice-Feedback-Using-a-Camera
This project detects the user's mood in real-time using a camera, processes the user's facial expression to identify the emotion, and then speaks out loud the detected mood. The system leverages Python libraries like OpenCV for capturing video, DeepFace for facial emotion recognition, and pyttsx3 for converting text to speech.
